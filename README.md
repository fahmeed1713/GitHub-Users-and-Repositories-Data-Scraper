# GitHub Users and Repositories Data Scraping

- This project scrapes GitHub user data for individuals located in Barcelona with over 100 followers, along with their repositories. 
- A surprising find was that many users with significant follower counts had few or no public repositories, indicating potential disparities between follower counts and activity.
- Developers should consider engaging with users who have many followers but limited contributions, as they may be open to collaboration or mentorship opportunities.
